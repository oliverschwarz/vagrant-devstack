# Simple LAMP devstack for Vagrant

_vagrant-devstack_ is a simple and lightweight LAMP devstack provisioning a Debian 8.2 (64-bit), a LAMP environment and the latest nodejs module.

## Prerequisites

* Install vagrantup.com and VirtualBox
* Ensure support for 64-bit virtualisation (BIOS setting) 

## Start engine

To initialise the system, simply clone this repo, cd into it and run `vagrant up`. Get a coffee - it will take some time on the first run.

## Have fun
